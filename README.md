RFID Powered Ticketing and Capacity Control System

This project introduces a smart bus ticketing system using RFID technology to streamline the boarding process and enhance security. By eliminating physical tickets, passengers can simply tap their RFID cards to pay for travel, providing a quicker and more convenient boarding experience.

Key Features:

Increased Convenience: Contactless RFID cards make boarding faster and easier.
Enhanced Security: Reduces ticket fraud and ensures accurate passenger tracking.
Sustainability: Eliminates the need for paper tickets, promoting eco-friendliness.
Cost Efficiency: Lowers operational costs by automating ticketing and reducing manual errors.
Capacity Control: Prevents overcrowding by allowing passengers to board only when seats are available, displayed on an integrated LCD screen.
Components:

Arduino Nano/UNO
RFID Reader and tags
Servo Motors (for entry and exit gates)
LCD display with I2C module
Lithium Battery, Buzzer, Motor Driver, etc.
Applications:

Public Transportation Management: Automates ticketing and seat allocation, optimizing bus schedules and reducing costs.
Integration with Smart Cities: Supports data-driven decisions for traffic management and route planning.
Future Scope:

Mobile app integration for remote ticketing and bus schedule checks.
Advanced security with biometric authentication.
Features for accessibility, such as priority seating.
